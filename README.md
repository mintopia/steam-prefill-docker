# Dockerised Steam Prefill

[![](https://dcbadge.vercel.app/api/server/BKnBS4u?style=flat-square)](https://discord.com/invite/lancachenet)

## Introduction

Dockerfile, docker-compose and helper scripts for running [tpill90](https://github.com/tpill90)'s [steam-lancache-prefill](https://github.com/tpill90/steam-lancache-prefill) within a docker container.

## Usage

Prerequisites

 - Git
 - Docker

Clone this repository and then use either the `SteamPrefill` command or `SteamPrefill.cmd` if you're on Windows.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mintopia/steam-prefill-docker.git
cd steam-prefill-docker
./SteamPrefill select-apps
```

For instructions on how to use SteamPrefill please read the [README on the GitHub project](https://github.com/tpill90/steam-lancache-prefill).

Config and cache data are written to bind-mounted volumes.

### Running without Docker-Compose

This is NOT recommended as it's more awkward, but if you *really* want to:

```bash
docker run \
  -v ${PWD}/Cache:/app/Cache \
  -v ${PWD}/Config:/app/Config \
  -it \
  --rm \
  ghcr.io/mintopia/steam-prefill-docker:latest \
  select-apps
```

This will use the latest image from GHCR.
